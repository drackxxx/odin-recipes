    <a>These fried dumplings are usually served with codfish in Jamaica as part of a big weekend breakfast.</a>
    <p>
        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li> 2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li> 1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
            <li> ½ cup butter, cut into cubes and softened</li>
            <li> ½ cup cold water</li>
            <li>1 cup vegetable oil for frying</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix flour, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl. Rub in butter until the mixture
         is crumbly. Mix in water, 1 tablespoon at a time, to form a firm dough; knead briefly.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large heavy skillet over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Break off pieces of dough and shape them into biscuit-like patties. Place just enough of the dumplings 
         into the hot oil so they are not crowded;
         fry until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. Remove from the pan and drain on paper towels before serving.</li>
    </ol>
